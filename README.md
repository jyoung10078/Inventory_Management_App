# Welcome to your CDK TypeScript project

This is a blank project for CDK development with TypeScript.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

## Useful commands

* `npm run build`   compile typescript to js
* `npm run watch`   watch for changes and compile
* `npm run test`    perform the jest unit tests
* `npx cdk deploy`  deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
* `npx cdk diff`    compare deployed stack with current state
* `npx cdk synth`   emits the synthesized CloudFormation template

# Next Steps

* Get the CodePipelines defined and running through the CDK. It looks like I am going to need to define a stack just for the different code pipelines that I will be creating. 
* Figure out how to deploy a basic Flask app through EC2 to the internet
* Figure out how I can integrate the code from the AI assignment on the website
* Start planning and designing the rest of the inventory management system through my AWS infrastructure
